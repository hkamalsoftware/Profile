My principal aim in the near future is to reach a position in the software and technology field where I can take on more responsibilities and make full use of my experience and skills in Software Technical Support and Development using C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, and Python. I am eager to contribute to innovative solutions, enhance system efficiency, and support users with both technical problem-solving and excellent customer service. Drawing from my background in Customer Service, Operations, Administration, and Sales & Marketing, I bring a well-rounded perspective that helps bridge the gap between technical solutions and business needs.
